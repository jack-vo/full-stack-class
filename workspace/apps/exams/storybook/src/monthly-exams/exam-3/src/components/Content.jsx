                        ax had always dreamed of the perfect Sunday: cozy bed,
                        snacks within reach, and every streaming service at his
                        fingertips. Today, that dream was finally coming true.
                        He had stocked up on popcorn, candy, and enough soda to
                        float a small boat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wrapped in his softest blanket, he flicked on the TV and
                        sank into the cushions. "This," he thought, "is heaven."
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Just as Max found the perfect movie, his phone buzzed.
                        It was a message from his friend Lisa: "Ready for our 5K
                        run?" Max's eyes widened in horror.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He had completely forgotten! With a groan, he looked
                        from the TV to his running shoes by the door. "Well," he
                        sighed, "it seemed like heaven... while it lasted!"
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
